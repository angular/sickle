/**
 *
 * @fileoverview TypeScript statically resolves enum member values to constants, if possible, and
 * directly emits those constants. Because of this, it also elides any imports for modules
 * referenced in the expressions of such constant initializers.
 *
 * The test below reproduces a problem where a compile-time constant value (such as another enum's
 * value) is only referenced in enum member. Because tsickle rewrites the enum to an object literal
 * initializer (`var ValuesInInitializer = {ENUM_MEMBER: Enum.X}`), TypeScript would no longer
 * replace the initializer with the constant value, but would still elide the import (for `Enum`
 * here). Thus we'd emit code that references an undeclared symbol.
